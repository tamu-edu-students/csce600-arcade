# ARCADE

## Project Overview

The development of Arcade is driven by the vision of our primary customer, Prof. Ritchey. Prof. Ritchey was frustrated with the monetization of platforms like the New York Times games, which require users to log in and pay for access. These barriers not only make the experience cumbersome but also limit accessibility for many users. 

In response, we are currently developing Arcade, an application that will offer a collection of games similar to those on the New York Times platform, but with free access and no mandatory login requirements. Users will be able to enjoy these games without creating an account or paying any fees, ensuring a seamless and unrestricted experience.

Arcade will also include an optional login feature to enhance the user experience. Logged-in users will have the ability to save their progress and view rankings across various games. However, the login remains optional, allowing users to enjoy the platform without any obligations if they prefer.

This project aligns with Prof. Ritcheyâ€™s goal of creating a more accessible, user-friendly gaming experience, free from the frustrations caused by monetized platforms.
